JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js.
JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more.
