javascript web scraping

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax
It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)

Prerequisites: A basic understanding of HTML and CSS, familiarity with JavaScript basics (see First steps and Building blocks) and OOJS basics (see Introduction to objects).
Objective: To understand how to work with data stored in JSON, and create your own JSON strings.
